# Project Saldo Familiar

## This is a simple project to find out about the family's financial situation.

    An array object with income and expenses is declared, there is a sum function 
    that scans all the elements of the array and adds them up, then displays the 
    edited sum of the elements, both income and expense, on the screen. Just below, 
    a function is created that subtracts the sum of expense and revenue amounts and 
    assigns it to a "situation" variable and to find out if the balance is positive 
    or negative, an if condition is created that checks if the "situation" variable 
    is less than zero, if it is, it shows that the balance is negative, if not, it 
    shows that the balance is positive.
